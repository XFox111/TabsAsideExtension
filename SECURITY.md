# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Tabs aside extension has a linear versioning system. The latest version is always the most secure one. If you are using an older version, please update it to the latest one.

We regularly run security audits and fix any security issues that are found. If you find a security issue, please report it to us as described below.

### 2.x EoL
With 3.0 release bringing substantial changes to the extension, 1.x and 2.x versions are no longer supported. Please update to the latest version.

If you are willing to continue using outdated versions, you can sideload it from the [releases page](https://github.com/XFox111/TabsAsideExtension/releases/tag/v1.3). Use outdated versions at your own risk.
