# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Tabs aside extension has a linear versioning system. The latest version is always the most secure one. This is applied to major versions as well. If you are using an older version, please update it to the latest one.

We regularly run security audits and fix any security issues that are found. If you find a security issue, please report it to us as described below.

If you are willing to continue using an older version, you can sideload it from the [releases page](https://github.com/XFox111/TabsAsideExtension/releases). Use outdated versions at your own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
