If you’re like me, you often find yourself with a bunch of open tabs. You’d like to get those tabs out of the way sometimes, but they’re maybe not worth saving as actual bookmarks.

In the Edge browser, Microsoft has introduced a new feature called "Tabs aside" (or Tab groups) which lets you set tabs aside in a sort of temporary workspace so that you can call them back up later.

Unfortunately, in new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, the devs decided not to implement this must-have-feature. So I've decided to create a browser extension which replicates this awesome feature in Chromium-based browsers

## Features
- Familiar UI inherited from legacy Microsoft Edge with some improvements
- Auto Dark mode
- Now you can restore one tab from collection without removing

## Download
- [Google Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-aside/mgmjbodjgijnebfgohlnjkegdpbdjgin)
- [Microsoft Edge Add-ons Webstore](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/kmnblllmalkiapkfknnlpobmjjdnlhnd)
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xfox111/chromiumtabsaside/releases/latest)

## To-do list
- Add ability to backup and restore saved tabs
- Add ability to share collections
- Add ability to add collections to bookmarks
- Add ability to sync saved tabs across different devices
- Add saved tabs thumbnails
- Add ability to reorder tabs inside collections
- Add ability to restore collections without removing them from the pane
- Add more languages (probably engage auto translator)
- Code cleanup
- Fix appearance on some websites
