Stemming its roots from the original Microsoft Edge browser feature, this extension has grown much bigger than just a temporary storage for tabs.

It allows you to save and manage your tabs in a convenient way, providing a range of features that make it easy to organize and access your saved tabs.

## Features
- **Save tabs**: Save all your open tabs in a single click, and restore them later
- **Organize tabs**: Create collections and subgroups to organize your saved tabs
- **Search tabs**: Quickly find the tabs you need using the search feature
- **Sync across devices**: Access your saved tabs from any device with your account
- **Go dark**: Dark mode support for a more comfortable browsing experience
- **Personalize**: Change the appearance and behavior of the extension to suit your needs
